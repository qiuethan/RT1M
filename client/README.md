## 🎨 Design System

### UI Components
The application uses a custom design system built with Tailwind CSS:

- **Colors**: Primary (blue), Secondary (green), Accent (purple), Surface (gray)
- **Typography**: Responsive text scales with consistent hierarchy
- **Spacing**: 8px base unit with consistent spacing scale
- **Components**: Reusable components with variant support

### Component Library (`components/ui/`)
- `Button` - Multi-variant button component with loading states
- `Input` - Form input with validation and error states
- `Select` - Dropdown select with custom styling
- `Modal` - Accessible modal with backdrop and focus management
- `Card` - Content container with multiple variants
- `Badge` - Status and category indicators
- `LoadingSpinner` - Loading states with different sizes
- `DatePicker` - Date selection component

## 📱 Phase 1 Features

### Authentication Flow
- **Login/Signup**: Email/password authentication with Firebase
- **Protected Routes**: Automatic redirection for unauthenticated users
- **User Profile**: Comprehensive profile management with education and experience

### Financial Management
- **Dashboard**: Net worth overview with key financial metrics
- **Income/Expenses**: Annual income and expense tracking with cash flow analysis
- **Assets**: Detailed asset management with categorization and valuation
- **Debts**: Debt tracking with interest rates and payment information
- **Real-time Calculations**: Automatic net worth and savings rate calculations

### AI Chat Integration
- **Mini Chatbot**: Persistent chat widget available on all pages
- **Full-screen Chat**: Dedicated chat page for extended conversations
- **Context Awareness**: AI understands user's complete financial profile
- **Data Extraction**: Automatic extraction and saving of financial information

### Goal Tracking
- **Multiple Goal Types**: Financial, skill, lifestyle, and project goals
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual progress bars and completion percentages
- **AI-Generated Goals**: AI can suggest relevant goals based on user data
- **Milestone Management**: Break down large goals into smaller milestones

## 🔄 State Management

### Context Providers
- **AuthContext**: Manages user authentication state and user data
- **ChatContext**: Handles chat history and conversation state

### Custom Hooks
- **useFinancials**: Manages financial data with optimistic updates
- **useAssetModal**: Asset creation/editing modal logic
- **useDebtModal**: Debt creation/editing modal logic
- **useOnboardingProtection**: Prevents navigation during onboarding

### Data Flow
1. **Authentication**: User logs in → AuthContext provides user data
2. **Data Loading**: Pages load data via custom hooks → Real-time Firestore sync
3. **Updates**: User makes changes → Optimistic UI updates → Firebase sync
4. **AI Integration**: Chat messages → AI processing → Data extraction → UI updates

## 🎯 Data Handling

### Null vs Empty States
The application distinguishes between:
- **Null**: Data not entered yet (shows "Add your first..." messages)
- **Empty Array**: User confirmed they have none (shows "You have no..." messages)
- **Populated**: Shows actual data with management options

### Form Management
- **Controlled Components**: All forms use controlled inputs with React state
- **Validation**: Client-side validation with error messaging
- **Optimistic Updates**: UI updates immediately, syncs with server
- **Unsaved Changes**: Protection against navigation with unsaved data

### Real-time Updates
- **Firebase Listeners**: Real-time data synchronization
- **Optimistic UI**: Immediate feedback for user actions
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error recovery with user notifications

## 🔒 Security Considerations

### Authentication
- **Firebase Auth**: Secure authentication with session management
- **Route Protection**: Private routes require authentication
- **Token Management**: Automatic token refresh and validation

### Data Privacy
- **User Isolation**: Each user can only access their own data
- **Secure API Calls**: All Firebase calls use authenticated user context
- **Input Sanitization**: User inputs are validated and sanitized

## 🎨 Styling & Responsive Design

### Tailwind CSS Configuration
- **Custom Colors**: Brand-specific color palette
- **Responsive Breakpoints**: Mobile-first responsive design
- **Component Variants**: Utility classes for component variations
- **Dark Mode**: Prepared for future dark mode implementation

### Mobile Optimization
- **Responsive Layout**: Works seamlessly on mobile, tablet, and desktop
- **Touch Interactions**: Optimized for touch interfaces
- **Performance**: Optimized bundle size and loading performance

## 🧪 Testing & Quality

### Code Quality

- **Prettier**: Consistent code formatting
- **Git Hooks**: Pre-commit hooks for quality checks

### Error Handling
- **Error Boundaries**: React error boundaries for graceful error handling
