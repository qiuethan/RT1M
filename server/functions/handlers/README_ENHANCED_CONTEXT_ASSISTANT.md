## Usage Examples

### Creating Goals with Submilestones
**User:** "I want to save $10,000 for an emergency fund"

**Assistant Response:**
```javascript
{
  message: "I'll help you create an emergency fund goal with actionable steps!",
  goals: [
    {
      title: "Emergency Fund",
      type: "financial",
      targetAmount: 10000,
      status: "Not Started",
      submilestones: [
        {
          title: "Open high-yield savings account",
          order: 0,
          completed: false,
          targetDate: "2024-01-15"
        },
        {
          title: "Save first $1,000",
          order: 1,
          targetAmount: 1000,
          completed: false,
          targetDate: "2024-02-15"
        },
        {
          title: "Reach $5,000 milestone",
          order: 2,
          targetAmount: 5000,
          completed: false,
          targetDate: "2024-05-15"
        },
        {
          title: "Complete $10,000 emergency fund",
          order: 3,
          targetAmount: 10000,
          completed: false,
          targetDate: "2024-08-15"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Editing Existing Data
**User:** "Update my emergency fund goal to $15,000"

**Assistant Response:**
```javascript
{
  message: "I've updated your emergency fund target to $15,000!",
  operations: {
    goalEdits: [
      {
        id: "goal_emergency_123",
        updates: {
          targetAmount: 15000,
          submilestones: [
            // Updated submilestones with new amounts
          ]
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Deleting Data
**User:** "I paid off my credit card debt, remove it"

**Assistant Response:**
```javascript
{
  message: "Congratulations on paying off your credit card! I've removed it from your debts.",
  operations: {
    debtDeletes: ["debt_creditcard_456"]
  }
}
```

## Implementation Guide

### 1. **Assistant Setup**
```bash
# Run the setup script
cd server/functions
node scripts/setup_context_assistant.js
```

### 2. **Environment Variables**
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
CONTEXT_ASSISTANT_ID=asst_...  # Will be provided by setup script
```

### 3. **Backend Integration**
The enhanced Context Assistant is automatically integrated into the existing assistant flow:

- **Router** → **Context Assistant** → **Database Operations**
- Edit/delete operations are processed in `updateUserDataViaAssistant()`
- All operations use batch database updates for efficiency

### 4. **Frontend Integration**
The client-side auto-refresh system automatically updates when the AI makes changes:

- Data changes trigger `onDataUpdated()` callback
- Pages refresh automatically to show updated data
- Success notifications confirm operations

## Best Practices

### For Goal Creation with Submilestones
1. **Logical Breakdown**: 3-7 manageable steps
2. **Progressive Targets**: Financial submilestones should build toward total
3. **Time-based**: Realistic target dates for each step
4. **Actionable**: Specific, achievable tasks

### For Edit/Delete Operations
1. **ID Precision**: Always use exact IDs from context
2. **Conservative Approach**: Only modify what user explicitly requests
3. **Validation**: Ensure operations make financial sense
4. **User Confirmation**: Provide clear feedback about changes made

## Error Handling

### Invalid IDs
- If ID doesn't exist, operation is skipped
- Logged for debugging purposes
- User informed of any skipped operations

### Data Validation
- All updates go through existing validation layers
- Invalid data is sanitized or rejected
- Maintains data integrity

### Rollback Support
- Database operations use transactions
- Failed operations don't affect other data
- Comprehensive error logging

## Testing

### Test Cases
1. **Create** new goals with submilestones
2. **Edit** existing goals, assets, debts
3. **Delete** items by ID
4. **Mixed operations** (create + edit + delete in one request)
5. **Invalid IDs** handling
6. **Malformed data** handling

### Test Commands
```bash
# Test goal creation with submilestones
"I want to save $20,000 for a house down payment with monthly milestones"

# Test editing
"Update my emergency fund to $12,000"

# Test deletion  
"I sold my old car, remove it from my assets"

# Test mixed operations
"Add a vacation fund goal for $5,000, update my house value to $350,000, and delete my old student loan"
```

## Monitoring

### Key Metrics
- Operation success rates
- Response processing time
- Data validation failures
- User satisfaction with AI changes

### Logging
- All operations logged with user ID and timestamp
- Detailed context about what changed
- Error tracking for failed operations

This enhanced Context Assistant provides a comprehensive financial data management system that understands user intent and can safely modify their financial profile while maintaining data integrity and providing excellent user experience.
